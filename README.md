## 📦 Getting Started

### 🔧 Backend (Jupyter Notebook)
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in the root directory.
2. Run the cells in sequence to start the backend model.
3. Ensure required Python libraries are installed (e.g., `TensorFlow`, `Pillow`).

> Note: This project uses a pre-trained model. If you're running it for the first time, ensure the model files are placed correctly and paths are updated in the notebook.

### 💻 Frontend
To launch the frontend:

```bash
# Open CMD or PowerShell
cd your-frontend-directory
npm install
npm run dev
